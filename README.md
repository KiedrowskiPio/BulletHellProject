# BulletHellProject
My first project in Unity, I will try to make a playable game in classic Danmaku (or Bullet Hell) style.

So far a working part is flying enemy from left to right and shoots bullets in basic pattern

Next step at this project will be making a player model and giving him option to move around and shoot.

All coding and unit models are made by me
